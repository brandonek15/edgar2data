                               POWER OF ATTORNEY

       Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Brian Mitts, Matt McGraner and Lauren Thedford signing singly,
the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

            (1)   execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
       undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of NexPoint
       Residential Trust, Inc. (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance
       with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
       thereunder;

            (2)   do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
       undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute
       any such Form 3, 4 or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
       thereto, and timely file such form with the United States Securities and
       Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

            (3)   take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
       with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be
       of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
       undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
       attorney-in- fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of
       Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and
       conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-
       fact's discretion.

       The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in- fact's substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the
rights and powers herein granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of the
undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the
undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

       The execution by the undersigned of this Power of Attorney hereby
expressly revokes and terminates any powers of attorney previously granted by
the undersigned relating to Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the undersigned's
holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company.  This Power of
Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the undersigned is no
longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the undersigned's
holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless earlier
revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing
attorneys-in-fact.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to
be executed as of February 24, 2020.


                                      /s/ Dennis C. Sauter, Jr.

                                   POWER OF ATTORNEY

        KNOW ALL BY THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned hereby constitutes
and appoints J. Kevin McCarthy, James J. Killerlane, III, Bennett E.

and lawful attorneys-in-fact for and in the undersigned's name, place
and stead to:

        1.  prepare, execute, and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and The Bank of New
York Mellon Corporation (the "Company"), for and on behalf of the undersigned,
pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, such statements
regarding the undersigned's beneficial ownership of securities of the Company
as required by law; and

        2.  prepare, execute and file with the SEC, the NYSE and the Company,
for and on behalf of the undersigned, one or more Notices of Proposed Sale of
Securities on Form 144 relating to the sale of shares of common stock of the
Company; and

        3.  do and perform any and all acts, for and on behalf of the
undersigned, which may be necessary or desirable for the preparation and timely
filing of any such reports or documents with the SEC, the NYSE and any other
authority; and

        4.  take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

        Said attorneys-in-fact and each of them shall have full power and
authority to do and perform, in the name and on behalf of the undersigned,
each and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary or proper to
be done in connection with any of the above as fully as the undersigned might
or could do if personally present, the undersigned hereby ratifying and
confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and each of them may lawfully do
or cause to be done by virtue hereof of this Power of Attorney and the rights
and powers herein granted.

        The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to
comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  The undersigned agrees that each
such attorney-in-fact herein may rely entirely on information furnished orally
or in writing by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact.

foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Power of Attorney
as of this 3rd day of August 2020.

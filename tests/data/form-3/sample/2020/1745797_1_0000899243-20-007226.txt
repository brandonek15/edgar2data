                               POWER OF ATTORNEY

                                 March 5, 2020

     Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints Blake C. Williams, Robert M. Roosa and Kari A. Potts of Brigham
Minerals, Inc. (the "Company") or any of them signing singly, and with full
power of substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

     1.   execute for and on behalf of the undersigned with respect to the
Company, Schedules 13D and 13G and Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Sections
13 and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

     2.   do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Schedules
13D or 13G or Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto, and timely file such form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

     3.   take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

     The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in- fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply
with Sections 13 and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

                            [signature page follows]

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of the date first written above.

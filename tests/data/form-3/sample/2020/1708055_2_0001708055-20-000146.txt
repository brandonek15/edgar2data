                                     POWER OF ATTORNEY



      Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints each

of Patrick Macken and Bruce W. McClelland, signing singly, the undersigned's true and lawful

attorney-in-fact to:



(1) prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's behalf, and submit to

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto,

and any other documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the

undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act") or any rule or regulation of the SEC;



(2) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity as a director

of Ribbon Communications Inc. (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section

16(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder, and any other forms or reports the undersigned may

be required to file in connection with the undersigned's ownership, acquisition, or disposition

of securities of the Company;



(3) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which may be necessary

or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5, or other form or report, and

timely file such form or report with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority; and



(4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing which, in the

opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally requ-

ired by, the undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact

on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall

contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's

discretion.



      The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do

and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in

the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes

as the undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or

revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-

fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of

attorney and the rights and powers herein granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing

attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,

nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of

the Act. This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the undersigned is no

longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transac-

tions in securities issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed

writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.





      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be executed as of

this 9th day of June, 2020.

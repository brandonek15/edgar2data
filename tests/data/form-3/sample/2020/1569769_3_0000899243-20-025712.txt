                                       Exhibit 24

         LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR SECTION 16 REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

        Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby makes,

        (1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
capacity as an Officer of Summit Therapeutics Inc. (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4,
and 5 (including any amendments thereto) in accordance with Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder (the "Exchange Act");

        (2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to prepare, complete and execute any such
Form 3, 4, or 5, prepare, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto, and timely deliver and file such form with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and any stock exchange or similar authority,
including without limitation the filing of a Form ID or any other application

Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system of the SEC;

        (3) seek or obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the
undersigned's behalf, information regarding transactions in the Company's
securities from any third party, including brokers, employee benefit plan
administrators and trustees, and the undersigned hereby authorizes any such

fact and approves and ratifies any such release of information; and

        (4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,

understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall

        The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power

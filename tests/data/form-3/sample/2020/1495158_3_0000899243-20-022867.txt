            and the rules thereunder;

        8.  do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned

            Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any
            amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such schedule or
            form with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

        9.  take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
            foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
            benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
            undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
            attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power
            of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and
            conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-
            fact's discretion.

        The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the

securities issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a
signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

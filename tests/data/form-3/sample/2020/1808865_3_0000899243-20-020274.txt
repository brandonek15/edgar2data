        (3)     take any other action of any type whatsoever in  connection
                with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-
                fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally
                required by, the undersigned, it being understood that the
                documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the

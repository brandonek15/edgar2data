                           LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY
                      FOR SECTION 16 REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

       Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby makes,

capacity as an officer of Schrodinger, Inc. (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5
(including any amendments thereto) in accordance with Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules thereunder (the
"Exchange Act");

       (2)    do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to prepare, complete and execute

       (3)    seek or obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the

ratifies any such release of information; and

       (4)    take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with
the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit

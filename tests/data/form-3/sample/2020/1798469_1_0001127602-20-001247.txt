LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY
FOR SECTION 16(a) REPORTING

	KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned
 hereby makes, constitutes and appoints James H. Roberts, M.
 Craig Hall and Betty Kwong, and each of them, as the undersigned?s
 true and lawful attorney-in-fact (the ?Attorney-in Fact?), with
full power of substitution and re-substitution, each with the
 power to act alone for the undersigned and in the undersigned?s
 name, place and stead, in any and all capacities to:

	1.	prepare, execute and file with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission, any national securities exchange or
 securities quotation system and Granite Construction Incorporated
 (the ?Company?) any and all reports (including any amendment
 thereto) of the undersigned required or considered advisable under
 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 ?Exchange Act?) and the rules and regulations thereunder, with
 respect to the equity securities of the Company, including Forms
 3, 4 and 5; and

	2.	obtain, as the undersigned?s representative and on
 the undersigned?s behalf, information regarding transactions in
 the Company?s equity securities from any third party, including
 the Company and any brokers, dealers, employee benefit plan
 administrators and trustees, and the undersigned hereby authorizes
 any such third party to release any such information to the
Attorney-in-Fact.

	The undersigned acknowledges that:

	1.	this Limited Power of Attorney authorizes, but does
 not require, the Attorney-in-Fact to act at his or her discretion
 on information provided to such Attorney-in-Fact without independent
 verification of such information;

	2.	any documents prepared or executed by the Attorney-
in-Fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Limited Power
 of Attorney will be in such form and will contain such information
 as the Attorney-in-Fact, in his or her discretion, deems necessary
 or desirable;

	3.	neither the Company nor the Attorney-in-Fact assumes
 any liability for the undersigned?s responsibility to comply with
 the requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any liability
of the undersigned for any failure to comply with such requirements,
 or any liability of the undersigned for disgorgement of profits
 under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; and

	4.	this Limited Power of Attorney does not relieve the
 undersigned from responsibility for compliance with the undersigned?s
 obligations under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including, without,
 limitation, the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the
 Exchange Act.

	The undersigned hereby grants to the Attorney-in-Fact full
 power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing
 requisite, necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the
 foregoing, as fully, to all intents and purposes, as the undersigned
 might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that
 the Attorney-in-Fact, or his or her substitute or substitutes, shall
 lawfully do or cause to be done by authority of this Limited Power
 of Attorney.

	The execution by the undersigned of this Limited Power of
Attorney hereby expressly revokes and terminates any powers of attorney
 previously granted by the undersigned with respect to the preparation,
 execution and filing of reports of the undersigned under Section 16(a)
 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with
 respect to the equity securities of the Company.  This Limited Power
 of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the undersigned
 is no longer required to file Forms 4 or 5 with respect to the
 undersigned?s transactions in equity securities of the Company, unless
 earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
 Attorney-in-Fact.

	This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed
 in accordance the laws of the State of California without regard to
 conflict-of-law principles.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Limited
 Power of Attorney as of this 1st day of January 2020.

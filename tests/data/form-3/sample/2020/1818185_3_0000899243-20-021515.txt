                               POWER OF ATTORNEY

                      FOR SECTION 16 REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

        KNOW ALL BY THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Robert Guenthner and Timothy Cook, signing singly, the
undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to: (i) execute for and on behalf
of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director
and/or owner of greater than 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Oak Street Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4 and
5 (including any amendments, supplements or exhibits thereto) in accordance with
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;
(ii) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4 or 5
(including any amendments, supplements or exhibits thereto) and timely file such
form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and
any stock exchange or similar authority, including the New York Stock Exchange,
and including without limitation the filing of a Form ID or any other documents
necessary or appropriate to enable the undersigned to file the Form 3, 4 and 5
electronically with the SEC; (iii) seek or obtain, as the undersigned's
representative and on the undersigned's behalf, information on transactions in
the Company's securities from any third party, including brokers, employee
benefit plan administrators and trustees, and the undersigned hereby authorizes
any such person to release any such information to each of the undersigned's
attorneys-in-fact appointed by this Power of Attorney and ratifies any such
release of information; and (iv) take any other action of any type whatsoever in
connection with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact,
may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney
shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as such
attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

        The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the
rights and powers herein granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of the
undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the
undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

        This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
earlier of (i) the date on which the undersigned is no longer required to file
Forms 3, 4 or 5 with respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transactions
in securities issued by the Company; (ii) as to the appointment of each of
Robert Guenthner and Timothy Cook, upon his respective resignation or
termination as an employee of the Company; and (iii) the revocation of this
Power of Attorney by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to each of
such attorneys-in-fact.  This Power of Attorney may be filed with the Commission
as a conforming statement of the authority granted herein.


        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to
be executed as of date first written above.

                                        Signed and acknowledged:

                                        /s/ Carl Daley
                                        ------------------------

                               POWER OF ATTORNEY

      With respect to holdings of and transactions in securities issued by

      1.    prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the
            undersigned's behalf, and submit to the United States Securities and
            Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments
            thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate to obtain
            and/or regenerate codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to
            make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by Section
            16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
            rule or regulation of the SEC;

      2.    execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, Forms 3, 4, and 5 in
            accordance with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
            as amended, and the rules thereunder;

      3.    do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
            undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete and
            execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment
            or amendments thereto, and timely file such form with the SEC and
            any stock exchange or similar authority; and

      4.    take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
            foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
            benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
            undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
            attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power
            of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and

      The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers

resubstitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorneys-in-fact substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the

      The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply

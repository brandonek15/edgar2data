Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints James A. Kirkland and A. Paul Rimas, or either of them signing singly,
and with full power of substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful attorney
in fact to:

(1)    execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
as an officer, director and/or more than 10% stockholder of Trimble Inc. (the
"Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(2)    do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5,
complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such
form with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

(3)    take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney in fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney in fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney in fact may approve in such

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney in fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
